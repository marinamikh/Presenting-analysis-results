Hello! Here is all the data I used for the HR analysis of AdventureWorks company project. 

In attachments there are all the .csv tables I used for my analysis in Tableau dashboard, and the data itself I got from 

https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db database, 
using the tables like EmployeeDepartment, Employee, EmployeePayHistory, Shift, and also writing 2 queries (added to the files as well) to accumulate and extract needed data.

The Tableau dashboard you can access here:

Also in attachments you can check two PP presentations, one for HR department, another one for Executive Leadership.
